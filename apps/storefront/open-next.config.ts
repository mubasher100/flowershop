/**
 * Incremental cache backed by R2.
 *
 * Without a persistent store, every Worker isolate renders pages from scratch
 * and re-fetches the Store API — which is why a cold homepage was taking
 * seconds even after the backend moved next to the database.
 *
 * The bucket (`flowershop-cache`) is in APAC, alongside the backend and
 * database, so a cache miss doesn't cross regions to repopulate. The binding
 * name is fixed by the adapter: NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET, set in
 * wrangler.jsonc.
